# Handwritten-Digits-Classifier
For this analysis, I use the hand-written digits dataset from UCI machine learning repository. This dataset is also preloaded in scikit-learn. I use different specifications of deep neural networks (DNN) model to classify the hand-writted digits. By increasing the number of layers, the accurary reaches up to 96%.
